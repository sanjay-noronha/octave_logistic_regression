# octave_logistic_regression
Octave code for logistic regression

This repository contains code from Andrew Ngs machine learning course and includes my solution.

In particular there is code for:
- cost function
- gradient descent
- plots
- fminunc implementation
- plot decision boundary
- changing a matrix to a higher degree polynomial
- 2 d scatter plot with different images for y (0,1)
- Regularization
